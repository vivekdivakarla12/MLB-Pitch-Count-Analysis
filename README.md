# Pitch Count Project

Baseball Pitch Count Project - Data Club 2022

Our project was revolved around baseball pitch count statistics. We found the data from baseball-reference.com and used python to try to analyze player performance on different pitch counts. In our findings, we found out that most players do better on favorable counts such as 2-0, 3-0 and 3-1, but struggled on the 2 strike counts. However, there were some differences between the best players compared to the average, as they had stronger averages in the pressure situations
